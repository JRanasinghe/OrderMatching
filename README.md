The OrderMatching system implements a simple order book with price time priority which allows users to enter orders and execute trades. 

Users can enter a Buy or Sell order (Bid or Offer) indicating a price and quantity. If the incoming order can be matched with one or more contra orders, a trade is executed and reported.
